A system,
Defined in this context by myself for this article

Is a protocol for writing, reading, transmitting and ‘holding’ information.

A system is a collection of ‘areas’ that serve a function that gives structure to a purpose.

Basic Fundamentals :

:Should be stable and created to work correctly:
Instead of a single error causing the failure of a operation,
It should be built around required actions/
Or rather, that if the protocol meets basic ‘points’ or requirements,
Then it should work, regardless of other variables.

Basically,
“As long as #variable is ###, and matches #variable, then operation should succeed”
Perhaps the result maybe have varying success, but the operation should still work.
