Design: Backpack
—

I really like backpacks, i guess.
I have a briefcase and that thing is amazing,
Really.
But it will never carry as much s a backpack.

So ive been looking for a very good backpack.
And its so hard to find one that has all the features i need, so im here designing one.

—Tactics Backpack—
Its main purpose is to carry just about everything, most for day-to-day use, and enough room to hold extra items, perhaps emergency items, water, and other extra items.

I want it designed to carry computer equipment also, having a special inside pouch that is absolutely watertight (or rather more than one pouch)
I want to be able to float on it if I crash out of a place (which will never happen) and know my 1-3k$ computer isnt ruined forever.

Basic Overview Design:
Has similar design as a basic fundemental backpack.

Except different also. Its has different compartments for different things.
So.

The first sleeve, which is the one closest to the uses back, houses a laptop up to 15 (maybe 17?). It has a zipper that has a built in lock, and inside that zipper is a triple layer sealable bag that it goes into (design to come?)
