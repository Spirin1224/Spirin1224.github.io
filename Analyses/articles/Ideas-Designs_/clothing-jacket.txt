Clothing: Jacket
—

I like jackets, (more than i like briefcases/backpacks)

And jackets are awesome.

I used to have like a macintosh/inspectors jacket,
You know the one with 2 rows of 4 buttons, and tons of buttons on it,
Like a trench coat really.

Coolest thing ever, and it had some of the coolest features.

No im desigining a jacket with the features i want.
